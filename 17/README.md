### Requirements

To run the calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the PySide6 library. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install PySide6
```

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the calculator by executing the following command:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

### User Interface

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the calculator is created using Qt Designer, and the UI file is loaded using the QUiLoader class. The calculator interface includes buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and various mathematical functions.
